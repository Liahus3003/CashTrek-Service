# Cashtrek Service - Backend for Personal Transaction Tracker
Cashtrek Service is a backend application built with Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, and TypeScript that serves as the backend for tracking personal transactions and viewing the dashboard to keep track of spendings. This readme provides an overview of the Cashtrek Service project, its features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

# Features
Cashtrek Service offers the following features:

Transaction Management: Cashtrek Service provides APIs for managing transactions, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting transactions. Users can perform CRUD operations on transactions, specifying details such as transaction type (income or expense), amount, category, and date.

Authentication and Authorization: Cashtrek Service includes authentication and authorization features to ensure that user data is protected and accessible only to authorized users. It uses authentication middleware to authenticate incoming requests and enforce authorization rules based on user roles and permissions.

Dashboard Data: Cashtrek Service provides APIs to retrieve aggregated data for the dashboard, including total income, total expenses, and expenses by category. This data can be used to generate visual charts and graphs on the frontend to give users an overview of their spending patterns and financial health.

Error Handling: Cashtrek Service includes error handling mechanisms to handle various types of errors, such as validation errors, database errors, and authentication errors. Proper error responses are sent back to the frontend to provide meaningful feedback to users.

Validation: Cashtrek Service validates incoming requests to ensure that they meet the defined data schema and business rules. Requests with invalid data are rejected and appropriate error responses are sent back to the frontend.

# Installation
To install and run Cashtrek Service locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Cashtrek Service repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/Liahus3003/cashtrek-service.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd cashtrek-service
Install dependencies: npm install
Build the application: npm run build
Start the local development server: npm run start
Cashtrek Service will now be running on http://localhost:3000/.
Note: Cashtrek Service requires Node.js and MongoDB to be installed and running on your machine.

# Usage
Once Cashtrek Service is installed and running, the frontend application can make API requests to interact with the backend and perform the following actions:

Create Transaction: The frontend can send a POST request to the /transactions endpoint with the transaction details to create a new transaction in the database.

Retrieve Transactions: The frontend can send GET requests to the /transactions endpoint to retrieve a list of transactions from the database, filtered by different criteria such as transaction type, category, and date.

Update Transaction: The frontend can send a PUT request to the /transactions/:id endpoint with the transaction details to update an existing transaction in the database.

Delete Transaction: The frontend can send a DELETE request to the /transactions/:id endpoint to delete an existing transaction from the database.

Retrieve Dashboard Data: The frontend can send GET requests to the /dashboard endpoint to retrieve aggregated data for the dashboard, such as total income, total expenses, and expenses by category.

Please refer to the API documentation for more details on the available endpoints and their usage.
